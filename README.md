# Cyclodextrin-PFAS Simulations

Cyclodextrin-PFAS simulation and analysis codes. <br />

## qMD4
This folder contains the .gro and .itp files for setting up cyclodextrins for simulation.   <br />

## interferents_gaff
This folder contains the .gro and .itp files for setting up interferents for simulation <br />

## system_cd 

This folder contains all relevant files for simulation of PFAS - Cyclodextrin systems. The folder is subdivided into subfolders containing the required scripts to assemble the simulations, equilibrate the systems and perform the molecular dynamics calculations.  <br />

## analysis

This folder contains the jupyter notebook and corresponding .py files for computing delta Gs and Kbs for any given system for your choice of grid and cutoff.
